# Sketches

This repo contains p5js sketches which are hosted at [netlify](https://cid-sketches.netlify.app/) so that these sketches can be embedded as iframes into external sites. Most of these sketches are used for creative coding teaching purposes which are mostly embedded into slides using [slides.com](http://slides.com/sojamo).
